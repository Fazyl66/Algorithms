# Algorithms
PYhop is not used in the above algorithms.
The algorithms are implemented, considering a Robot as an actor, on a 3x3 grid.
Note the the horizontal axis is taken as the Y-axis and the vertical is taken as X-axis.
Considering the motion is done in the forth quadrant, say if the robot has to move up (using move_up action) the x-coodinate changes to (x-1) from x
Similarly if it has to be moved right the Y coordinate changes to (y+1) from y.
